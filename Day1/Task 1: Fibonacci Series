In this task, we were asked to get the Fibonacci Series by taking the input from the user:-

Code:- 

puts "Enter the number of terms:"
set n [gets stdin]
set a 0
set b 1
set c 0
puts "Fibonacci Series:"
for {set i 0} {$i < $n} {incr i} {
    puts $a
    set c [expr {$a + $b}]
    set a $b
    set b $c
}
